# Title of the project

How to use this repository for project management:

## 1. Project related discussion and weekly updates
All project related discussion will happen through issues on Github.com. Create the first issue named 'Main discussion thread' if it is not already present and add the overall goal of the project there.  

In our weekly meetings, we will decide action items that you need to work on. These should be added appropriately as new issues or continued discussions in existing issues, and appropriately referenced in the Main discussion thread.

For each weekly meeting you should create a milestone on Github.com. All the action items that we discuss for the next week should be assigned to the next milestone. Once you finish that action item, you can add the results to the corresponding issue. That way the results are automatically collected together in the milestone before our next meeting.

## 2. References
All project related reading you do should be added as PDFs to the references folder. The files should be named following the convention `author et al_year_title.pdf`. Refer to this file in your issues when you refer to the paper. Typically you will also have an issue related to reading the paper where you can summarize whatever was relevant in the paper to our project.

## File organization
If you are designing an experiment, all experiment files should go in the `experiment` folder. Please follow the following steps:
1. Create a new branch on Github named . Install `github desktop` on the computer on which the experiment lives, and clone this repository there. Then create the experiment directly in the experiment folder of this repository only.
